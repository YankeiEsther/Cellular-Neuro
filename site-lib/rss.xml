Energy can change forms, but is neither created nor destroyed Entropy of an isolated system always increases. Entropy of a system approaches a constant as temperature approaches absolute zero. Why is there an equal number of solute molecules on both sides of the membrane at equilibrium Thermodynamic explanation at equilibrium is statistical
when there are a large number of solute molecules, it is vastly more likely that there will be a even distribution of solute molecules between to equal sized compartments Explained by the binomial equation <br><img alt="Pasted image 20250907130814.png" src="cellular-neurobiology/image/pasted-image-20250907130814.png" target="_self">
N = number of solute molecules in a given compartment M = the total number of solute molecules If N = 2 and M = 4 W = 6, meaning that there will be 6 different ways to equally distribute the 4 solute vs N=4 and M=4 → W = 1, there only one way to distribute all molecules in one compartment Each arrangement are equally likely
- meaning that it is 6 times more likely to equally distribute than clustered all in 1 compartment<br>

Why is there an equal number of solute molecules on both sides of the membrane at equilibrium Thermodynamic explanation at equilibrium is statistical
when there are a large number of solute molecules, it is vastly more likely that there will be a even distribution of solute molecules between to equal sized compartments Explained by the binomial equation <img alt="Pasted image 20250907130814.png" src="cellular-neurobiology/image/pasted-image-20250907130814.png" target="_self">
N = number of solute molecules in a given compartment M = the total number of solute molecules If N = 2 and M = 4 W = 6, meaning that there will be 6 different ways to equally distribute the 4 solute vs N=4 and M=4 → W = 1, there only one way to distribute all molecules in one compartment Each arrangement are equally likely
- meaning that it is 6 times more likely to equally distribute than clustered all in 1 compartment<br>
