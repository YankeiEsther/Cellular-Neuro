Why is there an equal number of solute molecules on both sides of the membrane at equilibrium Thermodynamic explanation at equilibrium is statistical\nwhen there are a large number of solute molecules, it is vastly more likely that there will be a even distribution of solute molecules between to equal sized compartments Explained by the binomial equation <br><img alt=\"Pasted image

molecules If N = 2 and M = 4 W = 6, meaning that there will be 6 different ways to equally distribute the 4 solute vs N=4 and M=4 → W = 1, there only one way to distribute all molecules in one compartment Each arrangement are equally likely\n- meaning that it is 6 times more likely to equally distribute than clustered all in 1 compartment<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250907130754.png\"
